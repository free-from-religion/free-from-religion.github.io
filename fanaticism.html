			I don’t know if this is just a random case or the norm. So, I don’t want you to hate every Orthodox person you encounter.<br>
			<span class="indent">I was born in 2006, in a very religious Greek village. My father believes some sort of god exists, but that he doesn’t fit in any religion. My mother is an Orthodox Christian. From birth, it was clear religion wasn’t going to be good for me. During baptism, I fainted and almost drowned, and growing up I was told to never question, just believe. I was harassed for having a Hispanic-looking skin, and my father was pretty much an outcast because of his beliefs.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">On my first day at middle school, a teenager was shot 24 times outside the school door. The reason? She was a Muslim. Another time, a car crash resulted in a car, with two toddlers inside, ramming into the school’s yard. The religion teacher didn’t teach, but preached. His lessons were lectures of hate towards atheists, blacks, LGBT, immigrants, basically anyone who wasn’t a white Christian man. That man had a habit of harassing girls who dressed just like normal 21st century girls. Once, he said to me: “Perhaps, it would be better for you if you died”.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">It was such a toxic environment. I was so deep into the shit we call the Orthodox Church that I started questioning my own moral integrity, instead of the system’s. I reached a point where I asked my dad if there was something wrong with me. He laughed and said: “The only thing wrong with you is your grades”.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">In the end of my junior year in middle school, I was finally questioning religion, rather than myself. Through the summer, my father made sure to keep me so incredibly busy that I had no time to be sad over that. Going to school in 2018 as a sophomore, I was almost certain that if God exists he is not worthy of being worshiped. I ended up becoming what I am now: an agnostic atheist. Of course, that didn’t come without its troubles. I was an outcast until we moved to the city, where I then tried to forget my early childhood trauma. And that’s where I am now.</span><br>
			<span class="indent">I’ve reached a point where I avoid passing in front of churches, in fear of being “attacked” again, as I had been so many times. That, Christians, is how you decrease in number. You make your children bleed until they can’t stand it anymore and have to leave, abandoning friends, abandoning memories, abandoning their lifestyle. I hope the system is at some point fixed or abolished.</span>
